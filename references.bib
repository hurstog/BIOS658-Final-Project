  abstract = {Skeletal metastases are frequent complications of many cancers, causing bone complications (fractures, bone pain, disability) that negatively affect the patient's quality of life. Here, we first discuss the burden of skeletal complications in cancer bone metastasis. We then describe the pathophysiology of bone metastasis. Bone metastasis is a multistage process: long before the development of clinically detectable metastases, circulating tumor cells settle and enter a dormant state in normal vascular and endosteal niches present in the bone marrow, which provide immediate attachment and shelter, and only become active years later as they proliferate and alter the functions of bone-resorbing (osteoclasts) and bone-forming (osteoblasts) cells, promoting skeletal destruction. The molecular mechanisms involved in mediating each of these steps are described, and we also explain how tumor cells interact with a myriad of interconnected cell populations in the bone marrow, including a rich vascular network, immune cells, adipocytes, and nerves. We discuss metabolic programs that tumor cells could engage with to specifically grow in bone. We also describe the progress and future directions of existing bone-targeted agents and report emerging therapies that have arisen from recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of bone metastases. Finally, we discuss the value of bone turnover biomarkers in detection and monitoring of progression and therapeutic effects in patients with bone metastasis.},

  abstract = {Bone metastasis occurs in advanced stages of breast cancer, worsening the quality of life and increasing the mortality of patients. Current treatments for bone metastasis are only palliative, and efficient therapeutic targets need to be still identified. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a large class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression within cells. Interestingly, the expression of certain miRNAs has been associated with several stages of bone metastasis progression, highlighting the importance of these small RNAs during the course of the metastatic disease. In this review, we aim to summarise the most recent findings on miRNAs and their mRNA targets in driving breast cancer bone metastasis. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility to use miRNAs as direct therapeutic targets or as advanced therapies for breast cancer bone metastasis, as well as their potential as predictive biomarkers of bone metastasis for an early diagnosis and a better tailoring of therapies for cancer patients.},

  abstract = {Background Bone is the most frequent site of metastasis for breast cancer (BC). Metastatic BC cells interact with bone cells, including osteoclasts and osteoblasts, creating a cancer niche where they seed and proliferate. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulators of breast-to-bone metastasis progression. MiR-24-2-5p has previously been shown to have roles in both breast cancer progression and inhibition of osteogenic differentiation. However, a direct link between miR-24-2-5p activity and the onset of bone metastasis remains ill-defined. Methods Analysis of the expression of miR-24 forms (miR-24-2-5p, miR-24-3p, miR-24-1-5p) in the serum from early-stage BC patients at baseline (time of surgery) was conducted. MiR-24-2-5p overexpression in BC cells (NW1, a luc2-positive subpopulation of MDA-MB-231, and MCF7) was obtained by miRNA mimic transfection or lentivirus transduction. MiR-24-2-5p downregulation in BC cells (ZR-75-1, T-47D, SK-BR-3) was obtained by miRNA inhibitor transfection. Cell proliferation, migration and/or invasion assays were performed to assess BC cell functions after modulation of miR-24-2-5p expression. An animal model was used to assess the effect of miR-24-2-5p overexpression on early BC metastasis formation, as judged by bioluminescence imaging, and on bone remodelling, following measurement of circulating bone resorption (CTX-I) and bone formation (P1NP) markers. The effect of conditioned medium from miR-24-2-5p-overexpressing BC cells on human and murine osteoclast differentiation was investigated. Endogenous miR-24-2-5p expression levels were also quantified during murine osteoclast differentiation. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of BC cells was performed to evaluate transcriptomic changes associated with miR-24-2-5p overexpression. Selected modulated transcripts upon miR-24-2-5p overexpression were further validated by real-time qPCR. Results Low expression levels of miR-24-2-5p, but not other miR-24 forms (miR-24-3p, miR-24-1-5p), in the serum from early-stage BC patients were associated with a high risk to develop future (bone) metastases. MiR-24-2-5p was also present in small extracellular vesicles secreted from BC cells. Forced expression of miR-24-2-5p in BC cells (NW1, MCF7) reduced their malignant traits (migration, invasion, and proliferation) in vitro. Furthermore, miR-24-2-5p overexpression in NW1 cells reduced metastasis, particularly in bone, and decreased bone turnover in vivo. RNA-seq and real-time qPCR analyses of NW1 and MCF7 cells overexpressing miR-24-2-5p showed the downregulation of common transcripts (CNNM4, DCTD, FMR1, PIGS, HLA-A, ICK, SH3BGRL2, WDFY, TRAF9B, IL6ST, PEX10, TRIM59). The conditioned medium from BC cells overexpressing miR-24-2-5p decreased human and murine osteoclast differentiation in vitro. Additionally, endogenous miR-24-2-5p expression levels in murine bone marrow-derived monocytes decreased during their differentiation into osteoclasts, further suggesting an inhibitory role for miR-24-2-5p during osteoclastogenesis. Conclusion MiR-24-2-5p exerts multiple protective roles in the early steps of BC bone metastasis by reducing malignant BC cell traits and tumour cell dissemination in bone, as well as by reducing the differentiation of precursors into mature osteoclasts.
